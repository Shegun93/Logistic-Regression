## Logistic Regression for Cancer Classification
# Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model to classify cancer data. The model is trained on a dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into training and test sets, and feature scaling is applied to standardize the data.
- Model Training: A logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score, achieving an accuracy of approximately 94.74%.
## Requirements
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
